# Weather Visualization using METARs and TAFs
By Alexander Wurts

## Data Source
Data retrieved live from aviation weather services, parsed and displayed to the user.

## Technology
React and D3 frontend powered by a nodejs backend. Hosted on a Google Cloud App Engine.

## Why?
I am a private pilot and wanted an easier way to check the weather for an airport from my phone or computer.  
This app visualizes the weather and allows anyone to search for an airport and see the most updated information.
